Rough log of what I've(Tyler) have done to get a work environment going.


1. Installed node version manager (nvm) to get the right version of node. Apparently theres only a Mac and Linux version so if you're on windows you'll probably need to find a windows fork.

2. Used node version manager to install node 4.6.1

3. Used npm to install express and mongoose(used to interact with mongodb). Anyone else doing this part now just needs to run "npm install" in the app directory to grab all the dependancies

4. To be continued...
