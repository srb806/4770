Basic getting started instructions for MunSN

1. Get mongodb and node.js (node --version v4.6.1, mongod -- version v3.2.11)
	-Probably need to use npm or something similar to get the right node version

2. Get basic node requirements: yo, grunt-cli, bower, generator-angular and generator-karma
	-If using npm the command is something like npm install -g yo grunt-cli..... etc

3. Run mongodb (the database not the shell). For linux this means starting the service. It varies otherwise.

4. Clone the git repo if you havent already

5. Install the requirements from the git repo(using npm or what-have-you)

6. You should now be good to go if I havent missed anything. "grunt serve" will get the site going and let you
   visit it in your browser.

notes:
	- yo is short for yeoman, its a scalfolding tool. Were using https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular
	  Use yo when creating new controllers, views and such. It'll do most of the setup for you, see github.

	- grunt-cli is a command line tool for serving the website. It does some useful stuff like
	  handling your file changes so that you can see them immediately in the browser. "grunt serve" gets you
	  a running environment
