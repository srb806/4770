Basic getting started instructions for MunSN

1. Get mongodb and node.js (node --version v4.6.1, mongod -- version v3.2.11)
	-Probably need to use npm or something similar to get the right node version

2. Get basic node requirements: yo, grunt-cli, bower, generator-angular and generator-karma
	-If using npm the command is something like "npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower... etc"

3. Run mongodb (the database not the shell). For linux this means starting the service. It varies otherwise.

4. Clone the git repo if you havent already

5. Install the requirements from the git repo(using "npm install" or what-have-you)

6. You should now be good to go if I havent missed anything. "grunt serve" will get the site going and let you
   visit it in your browser.

notes:
	- yo is short for yeoman, its a scalfolding tool. Were using https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular
	  Use yo when creating new controllers, views and such. It'll do most of the setup for you, see github.

	- grunt-cli is a command line tool for serving the website. It does some useful stuff like automatically
	  running tests and handling your test server. Again, the command "grunt serve" gets you
	  a running test environment.

	- I tried to make all the necessary controllers and views before hand. They're named obviously except
	  main is the timeline as its the default page once logged in and landing is to be a page you see
	  before you log in / create an account.

	- The command "yo angular:route NAME --uri=URLENDING" creates a route, controller and view with the
	  given name and address.

	- Tests should be written in the "test/spec/controllers/WHAT-I'M-TESTING.js" file. Its already got the
	  basic setup from yeoman so you'll mostly have to simply write basic tests and maybe some code to add
	  data to test beforehand. I posted a tutorial in the discord, though you'll need to skip to the writing
	  tests part since the setups handled.

	- ".editorconfig" is a file that syncs some basic project settings accross everyone's prefered IDE / editor.
	  Its optional but you might want to quickly check editorconfig.org to see if your editor needs a plugin to
	  support it.

	- "index.html" is the base site template, it contains the header, footer and some wrapper content like the
	  nav-bar. Individual views get dropped inside where it says "<div ng-view=""></div>"
